# HEX
HEX(HLA Extractor) is a simple HLA typing tool.

## Workflow

### Loading the IMGT database with HLA nucleotide sequences
1. ftp
2. processing to the fasta file with storing metadata
HLA 1st type -> 2-3-4 exons only
HLA 2nd type -> 3-4-5 exons only (?)

### Construction of the C-value matrix for alleles
C-value ("confuse value") is the probability that one allele is replaced with another by an error.
estimating 1st and 5th exons for missing data

### HLA extraction
???
